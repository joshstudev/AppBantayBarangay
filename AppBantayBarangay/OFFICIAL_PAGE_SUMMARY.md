8. Enters resolution notes
9. Confirms resolution
10. Report status updates, statistics refresh
```

### Secondary Workflow: Filtering Reports
```
1. Official views all reports
2. Clicks "Pending" filter button
3. List updates to show only pending reports
4. Statistics remain accurate
5. Can switch to other filters anytime
```

### Tertiary Workflow: Rejecting Invalid Reports
```
1. Official opens report details
2. Identifies report as invalid/duplicate
3. Clicks "Reject Report"
