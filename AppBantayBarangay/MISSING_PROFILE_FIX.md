## 🔍 Why Profiles Might Be Missing

### Common Causes:

1. **Registration didn't complete**
   - User created in Auth
   - Database save failed
   - Profile never created

2. **Manual account creation**
   - Admin created account in Firebase Auth
   - Forgot to create database profile

3. **Database rules issue**
   - Registration couldn't write to database
   - Auth succeeded but database write failed

4. **Old accounts**
   - Created before database integration
   - Only exist in Authentication

## 📝 Manual Fix (Alternative)

If you prefer to manually create profiles in Firebase Console:

```json
{
  "users": {
    "USER_ID_FROM_AUTH": {
      "UserId": "USER_ID_FROM_AUTH",
      "Email": "user@example.com",
      "FirstName": "Juan",
      "MiddleName": "A",
      "LastName": "Dela Cruz",
      "PhoneNumber": "09123456789",
      "Address": "123 Main St",
      "UserType": "Resident",
      "CreatedAt": "2025-01-15T10:00:00Z"
    }
  }
}
```

**Steps:**
1. Firebase Console → Authentication → Find user → Copy UID
2. Firebase Console → Database → users/
