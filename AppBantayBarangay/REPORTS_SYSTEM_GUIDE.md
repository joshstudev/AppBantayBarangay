## 🏗️ System Architecture

### **Data Flow**

```
Resident submits report
    ↓
Saved to Firebase: reports/{reportId}

## 👤 Resident Features

### **1. Submit Report (ResidentPage)**

**Location:** `Views/ResidentPage.xaml`

**Features:**
- 📷 Upload photo or take photo
- 📝 Describe the issue
- 📍 Capture GPS location
- ✅ Submit to Firebase

**Code Flow:**
```csharp
1. Resident fills form (description, photo, location)
2. Validates all fields are filled
3. Converts image to Base64
4. Creates Report object with:
   - Unique ReportId (GUID)
   - Status = Pending
   - ReportedBy = currentUser.UserId
   - DateReported = UTC timestamp
5. Saves to Firebase: reports/{reportId}
6. Shows success message
```

**Key Code:**
```csharp
var report = new Report
{
    ReportId = Guid.NewGuid().ToString(),
    Description = description,
    ImageUrl = imageBase64,  // Base64 image data
    Latitude = currentLatitude,
    Longitude = currentLongitude,
    LocationAddress = currentAddress,
    DateReported = DateTime.UtcNow.ToString("o"),
    Status = ReportStatus.Pending,
    ReportedBy = currentUser.UserId,
    ReporterName = currentUser.FullName,
    ReporterEmail = currentUser.Email
};

await firebaseService.SaveDataAsync($"reports/{reportId}", report);
```

---

### **2. View Report History (ReportHistoryPage)**

**Location:** `Views/ReportHistoryPage.xaml`

**Features:**
- 📊 Statistics (Total, Pending, Resolved)

4. Show status badges with color coding
5. Allow filtering by status
6. Show resolution details for resolved reports
```

**Key Code:**
```csharp
// Load only user's reports
foreach (var reportEntry in reportsData)
{
    var report = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<Report>(reportJson);
    
    // Only include reports submitted by this user
    if (report != null && report.ReportedBy == currentUser.UserId)
    {
        allReports.Add(report);
    }

## 🔧 Backend Implementation

### **Firebase Service (FirebaseService.cs)**

**Location:** `AppBantayBarangay.Android/Services/FirebaseService.cs`

**Key Methods:**

1. **SaveDataAsync** - Save report to Firebase
   ```csharp
   await SaveDataAsync("reports/{reportId}", reportObject);
   ```

2. **GetDataAsync** - Retrieve reports from Firebase
   ```csharp
   var reports = await GetDataAsync<Dictionary<string, object>>("reports");
   ```

3. **Data Conversion** - Convert Java HashMap to .NET Dictionary
   ```csharp
   private object ConvertJavaValueToNet(Java.Lang.Object value)
   {
       // Handles JavaDictionary, IMap, IList, primitives
       // Recursively converts nested objects
   }
   ```

---

### **Report Model (Report.cs)**

**Location:** `Models/Report.cs`

```csharp
public class Report
{
    public string ReportId { get; set; }
    public string Description { get; set; }
    public string ImageUrl { get; set; }  // Base64 image data
    public double Latitude { get; set; }
    public double Longitude { get; set; }
    public string LocationAddress { get; set; }
    public string DateReported { get; set; }
    public ReportStatus Status { get; set; }  // Defaults to Pending if null
    public string ReportedBy { get; set; }
    public string ReporterName { get; set; }
    public string ReporterEmail { get; set; }
    public string ResolvedBy { get; set; }
    public string DateResolved { get; set; }
    public string ResolutionNotes { get; set; }
}

public enum ReportStatus
{
    Pending,
    InProgress,
    Resolved,
    Rejected
}
```

---

## 🎨 Status Color Coding

```csharp
Pending     → Orange (#FF9800)
InProgress  → Blue (#2196F3)
Resolved    → Green (#4CAF50)
Rejected    → Red (#F44336)
```

## 🔐 Security & Permissions

### **Data Access Rules**

- **Residents:** Can only view their own reports
- **Officials:** Can view all reports
- **Updates:** Only officials can update report status

### **Firebase Rules (Recommended)**

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "reports": {
      "$reportId": {
        ".read": "auth != null",
        ".write": "auth != null"
      }
    },
    "users": {
      "$userId": {
        ".read": "auth != null && auth.uid == $userId",
        ".write": "auth != null && auth.uid == $userId"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

---

## 📊 Statistics & Analytics

### **Resident Statistics**
- Total reports submitted
- Pending reports
- Resolved reports

### **Official Statistics**
- Total reports in system
- Pending reports (need attention)
- In Progress reports
- Resolved reports

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **Reports Not Showing**

1. **Check Firebase Connection**
   ```
   Output window: [GetData] Snapshot exists: True
   ```

2. **Verify Data Structure**
   ```
   Firebase Console → Realtime Database → reports/
   ```

3. **Check User ID Matching**
   ```
   ReportedBy field must match currentUser.UserId
   ```

### **Status Not Updating**

1. **Check SaveDataAsync Success**
   ```
   Output: [SaveData] ✅ Success!
   ```

2. **Refresh Report List**
   - Navigate away and back
   - Or implement pull-to-refresh

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

1. **Push Notifications**
   - Notify resident when status changes
   - Notify officials of new reports

2. **Image Optimization**
   - Compress images before Base64 conversion
   - Use Firebase Storage for large images

3. **Offline Support**
   - Cache reports locally
   - Sync when online

4. **Advanced Filtering**
   - Filter by date range
   - Filter by location
   - Search by description

5. **Report Categories**
   - Road issues
   - Garbage collection
   - Street lights
   - etc.
